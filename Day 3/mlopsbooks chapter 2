first before we start anything in production we have to frame our machine learning model in clever and easy way to solve this is important if we frame the problem hard then we have to spend a lot of time on it.

so managers are only going care about business metrics and not about the model metrics. so business metrics is profits if I am making some profit by using what ml engineer told then I keep him if not why would I waste my money .


so our machine learning model does some predictions or recommends something due to that if we are saving or increasing the revenue then we succed the team is of use otherwise what is the use of this team.


so we convert machine learning metric to business metric and measure

Requirements of machine learning systems : 

RSCAM  reliability , scalability, adapatability, Maintainability


Reliability =  a person is said to be reliable only when he helps us in hard time not on good times.
