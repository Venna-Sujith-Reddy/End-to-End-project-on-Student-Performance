# Best Datasets for Machine Learning Practice

## 1. Titanic (Binary Classification)
- **Goal**: Predict survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Key Concepts**: Data cleaning (handling missing values), feature engineering, logistic regression, decision trees.
- **Why it's great**: It forces you to deal with messy real-world data (missing ages, cabins) perfect for beginners.

## 2. California Housing / Ames Housing (Regression)
- **Goal**: Predict median house values.
- **Key Concepts**: Linear regression, feature scaling, handling categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding), regularization (Lasso/Ridge).
- **Why it's great**: Contains a mix of numerical and categorical features, ideal for regression practice.

## 3. Iris / Palmer Penguins (Multi-class Classification)
- **Goal**: Classify species based on measurements.
- **Key Concepts**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Why it's great**: Small, clean dataset to understand how algorithms separate classes.

## 4. MNIST / Fashion MNIST (Computer Vision)
- **Goal**: Classify handwritten digits (0-9) or clothing items.
- **Key Concepts**: Neural Networks (CNNs), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
- **Why it's great**: The "Hello World" of deep learning. Good for visualizing high-dimensional data.

## 5. Mall Customers (Clustering)
- **Goal**: Segment customers based on annual income and spending score.
- **Key Concepts**: K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, determining optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method).
- **Why it's great**: No labels provided (unsupervised learning), great for visualization.

## 6. IMDB Movie Reviews (NLP)
- **Goal**: Sentiment analysis (Positive vs. Negative reviews).
- **Key Concepts**: Text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stopwords), Naive Bayes, RNNs/LSTMs.
- **Why it's great**: Introduction to Natural Language Processing.

## 7. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Imbalanced Data)
- **Goal**: Detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Key Concepts**: Handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE, class weights), Precision-Recall trade-off, Anomaly Detection.
- **Why it's great**: Real-world problem where accuracy is a misleading metric (99.9% accuracy might still miss all frauds).

## 8. Students Performance (Regression & Pipelines)
- **Goal**: Predict student scores (math, reading, writing) based on demographics.
- **Key Concepts**: Feature Engineering (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding), Building Sklearn Pipelines, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **Why it's great**: Excellent for practicing data preprocessing pipelines (handling categorical vs numerical data) and understanding feature importance.
