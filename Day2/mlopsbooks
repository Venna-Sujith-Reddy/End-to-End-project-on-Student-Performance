I cannot use Machine Learning everywhere  
1) do we have data ? with relevant features ? 
2) also sometimes ml will fail to capture the pattern in the data . if ml is failing it doesn't mean there is no pattern here but when we feel there is a pattern here we should use ml . But we never know if there is a pattern or not we can only find that by training the model and checking the performance.

Tha pattern should be complex if it is simple then we can use our knowledge to solve it. (This is zero shot learning)


We use a ml model trained on different data which is similar to our production

question) when can we use ml model that we developed ? 
answer) when the cost of wrong prediction is low compared to cost of correct predictions average. 

cost of correct is vague = we have to take average which is expected correct to wrong doing if it is greater we can use the ml model.

latency and response is like a water slide in a resort. the line is latency and whole from start to end is response time.
